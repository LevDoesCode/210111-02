            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
            at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics.

            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
            operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
            accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
            Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
            gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

          <h2>The Theory of Inflation</h2>
          <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, 
            which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly 
            in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

            <p>THE UNIVERSE  is just under 14 billion years old. From our position 
              in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 
              billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, 
              the universe has an even temperature.
            </p>
            <p>
              NOT ENOUGH TIME  The universe is not old enough for light to have 
              traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, 
              and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold 
              to mix into an even temperature.
            </p>
            <p>
              DISTANT COFFEE  At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look 
              a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of 
              steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.
            </p>
            <p>
              COFFEE EVERYWHERE  Now turn around and look a mile in the other 
              direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. 
              Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, 
              you might want to look for another explanation
            </p>

            <p>
              STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME  There has not been enough time to carry coffee 
              cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups 
              were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that 
              might explain their even temperature.
            </p>

              INFLATION  solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a 
              trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster 
              than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy 
              field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
              FLUCTUATION  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient 
              fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, 
              which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational 
              waves predicted by Einstein.
            </p>
            <p>
              EXPANSION  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding 
              faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is 
              something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the 
              froth and foam of the original pot.
